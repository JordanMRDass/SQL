## Functionality
### visual_data_analysis.ipynb
This code is used to detect possible fraudulent transactions in two seperate cardholders.
Outlier transactions are also displayed through the use of boxplots for another cardholder in a specific time range

### challenge.ipynb
For the challenge section of code, outliers are detected through the use of 2 different methods. First, 3 standard deviations away from the mean and second, outside the interquartile range (boxplot method). This displays the different outputs of the different outlier detection methods
